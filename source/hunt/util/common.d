 * general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.

     * if the close operation cannot fail.
     *
     * <p> Cases where the close operation may fail require careful
     * attention by implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish
     * the underlying resources and to internally <em>mark</em> the
     * resource as closed, prior to throwing the exception. The {@code
     * close} method is unlikely to be invoked more than once and so
     * this ensures that the resources are released in a timely manner.

     * wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource.

     * method should not throw it.

     * <p>Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}
     * method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this {@code close} method
     * is <em>not</em> required to be idempotent.  In other words,
     * calling this {@code close} method more than once may have some
     * visible side effect, unlike {@code Closeable.close} which is
     * required to have no effect if called more than once.
